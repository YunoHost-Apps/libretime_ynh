LibreTime makes it easy to run your own online or terrestrial radio station. It is a community managed fork of the AirTime project.
It is managed by a friendly inclusive community of stations from around the globe that use, document and improve LibreTime. Join us in fixing bugs and in defining how we manage the codebase going forward.
